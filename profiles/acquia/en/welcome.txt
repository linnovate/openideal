<div id="first-time"><h1 class="title">Welcome to your new Acquia Drupal website!</h1>
If you are new to Drupal, follow these steps to set up your web site in minutes:

<strong>Step 1. Start at the beginning</strong>

Visit the <a href="[[admin]]">administration section</a> for a task-based or <a href="[[admin/by-module]]">module-based</a> overview of the options available to configure your website.</li>

<strong>Step 2. Connect to the Acquia Network</strong>

At any time you can activate an <a href="http://acquia.com/network/">Acquia Network</a> subscription to gain access to Acquia's timely, professional support, automated services, and documentation. Acquia offers subscription levels for every size web site - from individual blogs to enterprise-scale, multi-site deployments.  Once you have your Acquia Network subscription keys, enter them on the <a href="[[admin/settings/acquia-agent]]">settings page</a>. Get started with a <a href="http://acquia.com/network/">free trial</a> today.

<strong>Step 3. Activate functionality</strong>

Turn on added functionality for your site - blogs, forums, polls, tags, comments, ratings, and more. Acquia Drupal comes with <a href="[[admin/build/modules]]">many modules</a> to power social publishing capabilities on your site.

Hundreds of additional Drupal 6.x compatible modules are available on Drupal.org in the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Modules">Drupal modules download section</a>.

<strong>Step 4. Start publishing content</strong>

Start <a href="[[node/add]]">creating content</a> for your site. Depending on which modules you have activated, you may see blogs, forums, polls and more as available content types.

<p>Some optional configuration tasks are shown below. For more information, please refer to the built-in <a href="[[admin/help]]">help section</a>, or the <a href="http://drupal.org/handbooks">online Drupal handbooks</a>.</p>

<strong>Choose a different design</strong>

Start by <a href="[[admin/build/themes/settings/garland]]">changing the colors</a> of the default theme.  To change the fundamental "look and feel" of your website, visit the <a href="[[admin/build/themes]]">themes section</a> and choose a theme from one of the many themes available out-of-the-box.

Many additional Drupal 6.x compatible themes are available on Drupal.org in the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Themes">Drupal themes download section</a>.

<strong>Configure the front page</strong>

The default front page is a listing of all content marked as <q>Promoted to front page</q>.  You can manage your content from the <a href="[[admin/content/node]]">content administration page</a>. You can also designate, for example, an item of content you have created as the front page. See the <a href="[[admin/settings/site-information]]">site information settings page</a> to configure the default front page path.  You can also add a slogan and mission statement to make the site your own.
