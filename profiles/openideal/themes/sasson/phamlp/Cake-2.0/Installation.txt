Installation of Cake wrapper for PHamlP
=======================================

The Cake 2.0 wrapper for PHamlP consists of a Haml view render (haml.php) 
and Cake specific implementations of the Markdown and Textile Haml filters.

Haml
====
* Put PHamlP in your vendors directory
* Put haml.php in your views directory
* Configure the view and HamlParser using
  Configure::write('Haml.<optionName>', <optionValue>);
  See haml.php and the PHamlP Wiki (http://code.google.com/p/phamlp/w/list)
  for a description of options
* Add the following line in your AppController.php
  var $viewClass = 'Haml';
* Create .haml views in your view folders
 
By default the parsed views (.ctp files) are cached under APP.tmp.haml

Haml Filters
============
* Put Markdown into the APP.vendors.markdown directory
  and/or Textile into the APP.vendors.textile directory
  NOTE: if you change the directory you will need to edit the filters
* Put the filters into a directory, e.g. VIEWS.hamlFilters
* Configure HamlParser to search this directory for filters
  Configure::write('Haml.filterDir', VIEWS.'hamlFilters');

Sass
====
* The current version of Sass seems to be a little buggy.
  You can use Fasset (https://github.com/ChrisCinelli/F-Asset) instead.
