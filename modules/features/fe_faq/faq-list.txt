Q: What are Challenges?
A: Challenges are containers for ideas. They can be put as questions that need answers, or problems that seek solutions, or most straightforward - subjects for which ideas are given.
Use challenges to gather ideas around a certain theme.
You can run several challenges in parallel, although it is recommended not to run too many challenges in parallel, so as to keep the users focused on a small number of problems, thus contributing to the discussion's quality and richness.
