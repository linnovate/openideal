    body: "Protecting all the forms is the easiest way to quickly cut down on spam on your site, but doing this disables Drupal's caching for every page where a form is displayed.\r\n\r\nNote: If you have the honeypot time limit enabled, this option may cause issues with Drupal Commerce product forms or similarly-sparse forms that are able to be completed in a very short time."

    body: 'Spam bots typically fill out any field they believe will help get links back to their site, so tempting them with a field named something like ''url'', ''homepage'', or ''link'' makes it hard for them to resist filling in the fieldâ€”and easy to catch them in the trap and reject their submissions!'

    body: 'If you enter a positive value, Honeypot will require that all protected forms take at least that many seconds long to fill out. Most forms take at least 5-10 seconds to complete (if you''re a human), so setting this to a value < 5 will help protect against spam bots. Set to 0 to disable.'
