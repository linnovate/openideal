**OpenideaL** (OI) is the leading open source ideas and innovation management system.

Out of the box it provides an ideation community where citizens, employees, clients or any other group of stake holders can create, discuss, rate and promote ideas. 

Since 2010 OpenideaL is in use by various organizations including multi-national and top-500  companies, governments, cities, universities and NGOs. 

OpenideaL includes tools for the website managers which allow them to identify *successful* ideas (those ideas which have a better chance to be relaized), and to pass them along to professional teams within the organization. Community members are rewarded with points for their activity in the system (creating ideas, participating in discussions etc.)

OI is based on Drupal, and therefore it is modular, and allows growth and adaptation to the organization’s specific needs. These adaptations may include a unique design, polls and surveys, interfacing with external applications or adapting the interface to a range of devices ans apis.

## Installation

OpenideaL is super easy to install. The following composer command will install the full codebase, together with all the required dependencies and libraries:

```
composer create-project linnovate/openideal_project
```

Once the command has finishd executing, point your webserver to the `web` directory and start innovating.
